**Project Title**:  
Fashion Image Recommendation System Using ResNet and K-NN

---

**Project Overview:**

In the modern e-commerce era, delivering tailored fashion recommendations can greatly enhance user experience and sales. This project showcases the development of an advanced recommendation system for fashion products using deep learning and similarity search techniques.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Dataset**: The system utilizes the renowned fashion product image dataset from Kaggle, comprising a diverse array of fashion categories.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: The heart of the system lies in the ResNet modelâ€”a leading convolutional neural network. This model is adept at capturing intricate visual patterns and details from images, enabling the generation of meaningful embeddings.

3. **Data Handling**: The dataset was judiciously partitioned into training and testing subsets. This ensured an unbiased evaluation and the ability to test the recommendation efficacy on unseen data.

4. **Recommendation Strategy**: Upon extracting image embeddings using ResNet, the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm was employed. This similarity search technique matches the test image embeddings with the training dataset, pinpointing visually analogous fashion items.

**Potential Applications**:

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Integration into online fashion stores to suggest similar products to users based on their viewing patterns.

- **Fashion Apps**: Enabling users to upload images of attire they like and receive suggestions of similar items available for purchase.

- **Personalized Advertising**: Targeting users with products visually resembling those they've shown interest in, leading to more engaging ad campaigns.
